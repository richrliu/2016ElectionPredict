Predicting County Presidential Winners


We have included a data file for training named train_potus_by_county.csv which includes some metadata about a county
and who won in that county's election. You job is to create a model that correctly predicts who won in that county.


Your completed homework answer should require no more than 2 hours of work and be a zipfile with the following:

1) build_model script: should read train_potus_by_county.csv and then build, train and tune your best predictive model.
The script should save your best model to the filesystem and it should also log data about the expected performance of
the model to a text file performance.txt

2) make_predictions script: should load your saved model generated by the first script, read the file test_potus_by_county.csv
and output a predictions.csv file with your predictions (one prediction per line)

3) model binary: serialized version of your best model from running step 1

4) predictions.csv: one prediction per line that is in the same order as test_potus_by_county.csv

5) performance.txt: the data about the expected performance of your model, how you evaluated the best model

6) notes.txt: should include the software dependencies for your code, optionally any notes about how you chose your model, 
how you engineered your features, what other options you wanted to explore but didn't have time.



Feel free to use whatever standard machine learning packages you'd like. Please only use software that's easy to install
so we can validate your work.

Do not use additional data from the internet. However you can derive new features from the existing data.

The homework will be judged based upon the performance of the model, the quality/clarity of the code, and finally the
methodology of the best feature/model selection.
